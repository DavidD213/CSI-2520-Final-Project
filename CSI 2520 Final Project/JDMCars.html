    <h3>History</h3>
    <p id="JDMHistory">Vehicles associated with the term JDM, also known as the Japanese Domestic Market, have gained a reputation of their own in past couple of decades. Starting with it's culture, most JDM cars are seen as japanese exclusive sports cars of the late 80s and 90s. While any car exclusicely sold in japan is a JDM car, cars like the Nissan R32 and R33, the Toyota 86, and the Mazda RX-7 FC and FD were the main focus when it came to JDM cars. These JDM cars gained popularity mainly becuase of their tuneability. This meant that each car had the ability to be tuned to a specific type of driving and even racing style. Back in the 90s these JDM cars were a staple when it came to illegal street racing. During this time in Japan, the most popular types of street racing were racing on the expressway and racing on the mountain passes. Starting with the iilegal street racing on the expressway, the most regarded place that people raced at was the shuto expressway in Tokyo. The most notorious racing group associated with this type of street racing was the Mid Night Club. This group became world famous for the speeds they would achieve on the expressway exceeding 300 km/h(190 mmph). While this group tried to stay hidden from the public as much as possible, their legacy still lives on in the culture of JDM. Moving on to mountain pass street racing, also know as touge, this type of racing also gave way for the JDM culture to strive to what it is today. Touge racing, called battles, are typically done at night between two cars essentially playing cat and mouse. The most common cars used in touge racing were usually lighter and smaller cars such as the AE86, Honda civic, Nissan silvia's, Nissan skyline's, and Mazda RX-7's. Touge racing was also made popular by the anime/manga series Initial D which is about the main character racing in his AE86 on the mountain passes. To this day the JDM culture still strives all over the world with different with many other car cultures putting their own twist to it.  </p>
